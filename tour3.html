<h2> ATHIRAPILLY </h2>
<img style="width:500px; height:250px; float:left;" src="athirappalli.jpg">
<p style="font-size:25px; color:#00FFFF; text-indent:300px; text-shadow:none;">Athirappilly Falls, is situated in Athirappilly Panchayat in Chalakudy Taluk of Thrissur District in Kerala, India on the Chalakudy River, which originates from the upper reaches of the Western Ghats at the entrance to the Sholayar ranges. It is the largest waterfall in Kerala, which stands tall at 80 feet. Just a short drive from Athirappilly to the Vazhachal falls, which is close to dense green forests that are home to many endangered and endemic species of flora and fauna.

There is another waterfall on the way from Athirappilly to Vazhachal Falls, in close proximity to the road, which is locally called "Charpa Falls". Athirappilly Falls is the largest waterfall in Kerala and is nicknamed "The Niagara of India".The 145 kilometres (90 mi) long Chalakudy River, originates in the Anamudi mountains of the Western Ghats and flows through the Vazhachal Forest toward the Arabian Sea. The river initially runs smoothly but becomes more turbulent as it nears Athirapilly. At Athirappilly Falls, the water surges around big rocks and cascades down in three separate plumes. Below the falls, the river remains turbulent for about 1 kilometre (0.62 mi) until it reaches Kannamkuzhi. Then it calms and flows smoothly until reaching the dam at Thumburmuzhi.</p>
<h2 style="text-align:right;"> SOOCHIPARA </h2>
<img style="width:500px; height:250px; float:right;" src="soochipara.jpg">
<p style="font-size:25px; color:#00FFFF; text-indent:300px; text-shadow:none;">Soochipara Falls also known as Sentinel Rock Waterfalls is a three-tiered waterfall in Vellarimala, Wayanad, India. It is surrounded by deciduous, evergreen and montane forests. Locally referred to as Soochipara ("Soochi" meaning "Needle" and "Para" meaning "Rock"), the 15-20 minute drive from Meppadi to Sentinel Rock Waterfalls has views of a number of Wayanad's tea estates.The Sentinel Rock Waterfalls is 200 metres (656 feet) and offers a cliff face that is used for rock climbing.The water from Soochipara Falls,later joins Chulika River or popularly known as Chaliyar River after Velarimala Hills near Cherambadi (Tamil Nadu) in Kerala.

Once people reach the parking area, they have to pass through a security check at the entrance where they make sure you don't carry any plastic. It takes 10-15 minutes walk to the waterfalls and water flow is less during summer, which makes it easy to reach the rocks where water falls.</p>
<h2 style="text-align:left;"> PALARUVI </h2>
<img style="width:500px; height:250px; float:left;" src="thenmala.jpg">
<p style="font-size:25px; color:#00FFFF; text-indent:300px; text-shadow:none;">Palaruvi Waterfalls, which literally translates to ‘Stream of Milk’, comes down through rocks from a height of 300 feet. This has turned into a delightful picnic spot where one can enjoy a spectacular view uninterrupted. The rocky terrain one has to traverse before reaching it can be cumbersome but once these majestic waterfalls come into sight, any kind of fatigue disappears immediately. The cool water is frequented by those seeking a refreshing dip and it regularly attracts people in large numbers.As for photographing the Palaruvi Falls, I found out that it wasn’t easy as the most direct view of the falls was only available in the ladies only section so only the ladies could get it.

However, even that view wasn’t that great thanks to large boulders obstructing views of the bottommost sections of the tall waterfall.

The difficulty was exacerbated because the male-only side appeared to be off limits due to a rockfall (probably the same one that obstructed views from the ladies side) that apparently washed out a bridge.</p>
